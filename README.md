# Graph signal sampling

We measure values of a real valued smooth signal on the specific nodes of on a network using graph signal sampling.

Using these known values, we can predict the signal values on the remaining nodes of a network.

# How to sample graph signals

The software in this repository implements the *Approximate volume maximization* algorithm for graph signal sampling from [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.10506).
